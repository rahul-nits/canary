# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: "Ingress resources were ignored initially because they lacked an ingress.class annotation; had to add 'kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx\"'.\nCanary rollout required explicit --set of image tag because release values can be preserved by Helm."
  suggested_improvements: "Add ingress.class annotations in chart by default; add a post-update hook or annotation to trigger pod restarts when ConfigMap changes; include automated smoke tests for canary UI changes before public rollout."
